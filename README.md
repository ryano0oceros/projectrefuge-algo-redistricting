## New Jersey Redistricting Project

This repository contains a comprehensive solution for redistricting New Jersey into six contiguous congressional districts. The project applies integer programming techniques to ensure that each district satisfies population balance constraints, contiguity, and compactness. The repository includes Python code, a detailed report, and visual outputs to support this analysis.

## Repository Contents
- redistrict.py: The main Python script using PuLP to solve the integer programming problem for district assignments. This script reads county data, applies adjacency and population balance constraints, and assigns counties to districts based on the optimization results.
- njcolormap.py: A Python script that uses GeoPandas and Matplotlib to visualize the resulting districts on a color-coded map. The map highlights the population distribution across the districts and confirms contiguity.
- Fallon_NJRedistrictingProject.pdf: The detailed report that outlines data sources, objective function and constraints, programming methodology, solution validation, and analysis of the generated districts.
- nj_congressional_districts_map.png: The output image generated by njcolormap.py, showing the map of New Jersey with the district assignments based on the optimization results.
